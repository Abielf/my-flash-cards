# Abe made a thing!
Specifically, a little rinky-dink flash card app made in react. Once you open the project, 
you should be prompted to download the NPM. After that, just type:

NPM Start

in the intellij terminal, and the app should open in your browser. If you want to modify the question bank, just change the data.js file.
