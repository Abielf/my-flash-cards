# Abe made a thing!
UPDATE: 4/28/21 App is live! No need for messy downloads, now it's as easy as visiting https://abes-flash-cards.herokuapp.com

Made some changes to commemorate the launch. Added a previous card button and fixed an out of bounds array error


Just a little rinky-dink flash card app made in react. Once you open the project, 
you should be prompted to download the NPM dependency. If you aren't prompted automatically, 
just type npm install in the terminal. Once the dependency is installed, type the command npm start and
you should be on your way. The app should open in your dominant internet browser.

If you wanted to modify and personalize the question bank, just change the data.js file. Right now it's got 240 questions, each
represented by a jSON object with a front and back.
